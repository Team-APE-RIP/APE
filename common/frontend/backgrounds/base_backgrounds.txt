# Database for all the backgrounds in the game example:
# name_of_dds_file = { (The dds file needs to be stored in the gfx/loadingscreens folder)
# dlc_allowed = (optional) which Dlc enables this background
# locale = (optional) The default background will be decided by latest dlc, if there is a locale set then it will try to best match the default background to 
#the language
# gfx = (optional) on default we override the GFX_frontend_bg_basic, so only set if you want a different resolution or effects
# }

#IMPORTANT
# You will also need to create a GFX for the small icons to appear,and it should be named GFX_name_small. We have support for 1 small image to show without
# the need to recreate the it, however that is not scalable. So if you want to have more images / make your mod compatible with other mods you have to add it
